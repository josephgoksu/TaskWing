  <Overview>

  <KeyFeatures>
    <Feature>AI-Powered Task Generation: Automatically generate a complete project plan from a Product Requirements Document (PRD), including tasks, subtasks, priorities, and dependencies.</Feature>
    <Feature>Automated PRD Refinement: Optionally use an LLM to automatically improve your PRD for better clarity and more accurate task generation before planning.</Feature>
    <Feature>Interactive CLI Workflow: A powerful and user-friendly command-line interface for all core operations, with interactive prompts for creating, viewing, and completing tasks.</Feature>
    <Feature>Hierarchical &amp; Dependency-Aware: Full support for creating nested subtasks and defining dependencies between tasks, ensuring a logical project flow.</Feature>
    <Feature>Advanced Task Views: List tasks in a simple table or a hierarchical tree view. Powerful filtering by status, priority, or text search, and sorting by any field.</Feature>
    <Feature>Robust Local-First Storage: Persist tasks locally in JSON, YAML, or TOML. Data integrity is ensured through file locking and checksum verification.</Feature>
    <Feature>Secure &amp; Configurable: All configurations and API keys are stored locally and never leave your machine. Configure your preferred LLM provider (OpenAI currently supported) and model via config files or environment variables.</Feature>
    <Feature>Project Scaffolding &amp; Portability: Use the `init` command to quickly set up a new project. Built-in backup and restore commands make your data portable.</Feature>
