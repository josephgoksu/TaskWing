## Decision Log

### Decision: Keep MCP.md as Separate File
**Date**: 2025-01-19  
**Context**: MCP documentation was fragmented across 4 files  
**Decision**: Consolidate into single MCP.md file instead of merging with main docs  
**Rationale**: Complex topic deserves dedicated, comprehensive documentation  
**Outcome**: ✅ Successful - improved clarity and discoverability  
**Impact**: Users can find all MCP information in one place

### Decision: JSON Format for Archives
**Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Context**: Need machine-readable format for AI integration  
**Decision**: Use JSON instead of YAML or plain text  
**Rationale**: Better parsing performance and AI tool compatibility  
**Outcome**: ✅ Successful - enables MCP resource integration  
**Impact**: AI tools can easily access and analyze historical data

### Decision: Hierarchical Archive Storage
**Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Context**: Archive storage organization for scalability  
**Decision**: Use year/month directory structure  
**Rationale**: Prevents directory bloat and enables chronological navigation  
**Outcome**: ✅ Successful - clean organization and fast access  
**Impact**: Archives remain organized even with high project volume

## Lessons Learned

### Documentation Projects
1. **Start with Audit**: Comprehensive analysis prevents missed content and reveals hidden patterns
2. **Design First**: Structure planning before implementation saves significant rework
3. **Progressive Consolidation**: Move content gradually to prevent loss and maintain continuity
4. **Test Immediately**: Quick validation catches breaking changes and integration issues
5. **Single Purpose Files**: Each document should have one clear, distinct purpose

### System Development
1. **Detailed Design**: Upfront specification prevents implementation confusion
2. **Error Handling**: Good error messages improve user experience significantly
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify new components work with existing systems
4. **User Feedback**: Interactive prompts help collect valuable metadata

### General Project Management
1. **High-Priority Sequences**: Critical tasks should be completed before dependent work
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Similar projects benefit from established workflows
3. **Metric Collection**: Quantitative data helps improve future estimations
4. **Retrospective Value**: Post-project analysis captures insights that would otherwise be lost

## Best Practices

### Task Planning
- ✅ Break complex work into phases (Audit → Design → Implement → Cleanup)
- ✅ Use high priority for foundational tasks, medium for refinements
- ✅ Include testing and verification tasks in all projects
- ✅ Plan cleanup and documentation tasks from the start

### Documentation
- ✅ Follow user journey progression (basic → intermediate → advanced)
- ✅ Maintain single source of truth for each topic
- ✅ Use consistent formatting and cross-references
- ✅ Include practical examples and command references

### Development
- ✅ Design before coding with comprehensive specifications
- ✅ Use JSON for machine-readable data formats
- ✅ Implement hierarchical organization for scalability
- ✅ Add interactive elements for better user experience

### Quality Assurance

## Common Pitfalls

### Documentation Projects
- ❌ **Content Loss**: Moving too quickly without careful content mapping
- ❌ **Broken References**: Not updating links when moving or consolidating content
- ❌ **Inconsistent Tone**: Mixing different writing styles without standardization
- ❌ **Over-consolidation**: Creating files that are too large and unwieldy

### System Development
- ❌ **Incomplete Design**: Starting implementation without clear specifications
- ❌ **Poor Error Messages**: Generic errors that don't help users understand issues
- ❌ **Missing Integration**: Not testing how new features work with existing systems
- ❌ **Inadequate Documentation**: Building features without usage examples

### Project Management
- ❌ **Dependency Confusion**: Starting dependent tasks before prerequisites are complete
- ❌ **Scope Creep**: Adding unplanned features without adjusting timelines
- ❌ **Insufficient Testing**: Not validating work before considering tasks complete
- ❌ **Missing Retrospectives**: Losing valuable insights by not capturing lessons learned
