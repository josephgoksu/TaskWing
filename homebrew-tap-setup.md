# Homebrew Tap Setup Instructions

To complete the Homebrew installation method for TaskWing, you need to create the `homebrew-tap` repository.

## Steps to Set Up Homebrew Tap

1. **Create the Repository**

   ```bash
   # Go to GitHub and create a new repository named 'homebrew-tap'
   # Repository URL: https://github.com/josephgoksu/homebrew-tap
   ```

2. **Initialize the Repository**

   ````bash
   git clone https://github.com/josephgoksu/homebrew-tap
   cd homebrew-tap

   # Create basic structure
   mkdir Formula
   echo "# TaskWing Homebrew Tap" > README.md
   echo "## Installation" >> README.md
   echo "" >> README.md
   echo '```bash' >> README.md
   echo "brew tap josephgoksu/tap" >> README.md
   echo "brew install taskwing" >> README.md
   echo '```' >> README.md

   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Setup homebrew tap for TaskWing"
   git push origin main
   ````

3. **Test the Setup**
   After the next TaskWing release, GoReleaser will automatically:
   - Generate the Homebrew formula
   - Commit it to the `Formula/` directory
   - Users can then install via `brew tap josephgoksu/tap && brew install taskwing`

## Repository Structure

```
homebrew-tap/
├── README.md
└── Formula/
    └── taskwing.rb  # Auto-generated by GoReleaser
```

## Formula Details

GoReleaser will automatically generate a formula similar to:

```ruby
class Taskwing < Formula
  desc "AI-assisted CLI task manager for developers"
  homepage "https://github.com/josephgoksu/TaskWing"
  license "MIT"

  # Auto-populated with release info
  url "https://github.com/josephgoksu/TaskWing/releases/download/v1.0.0/taskwing.app_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz"
  sha256 "..."

  def install
    bin.install "taskwing"
  end
end
```

## Next Steps

1. Create the repository on GitHub
2. Run the next TaskWing release
3. Verify the formula was generated correctly
4. Test installation: `brew tap josephgoksu/tap && brew install taskwing`
